# About the project
This is a simple counter. It starts from 0, a number you can increment or decrement by 1 or 10.
To spice things up, the counter is expressed in Celsius grades, that correspond to a specific drink.

## Why this project?
I made this project to put into practice my JavaScript skills in the JavaScript Basics course provided by the start2impact community.

<br>

## Features
Main features of the project and the way it was built.

<br>

### Code
The code I used to build this project includes: 

 * `JavaScript`: to add and manipulate the main content of the project;
 * `HTML`: to add metadata and the `return to my personal website` button on the top-left of the page;
 * `Sass`: to customise the `return to my personal website` button, add animations and make the project responsive with `@media` queries.

<br>

### How to use
You can change the counter's value by:
 * clicking on the buttons shown on the screen
    - `+1` increases the value by 1
    - `-1` decreases the value by 1
    - `+10` increases the value by 10
    - `-10` decreases the value by 10
    <br>
 * pressing keyboard keys:
    - `→` increases the value by 1
    - `←` decreases the value by 1
    - `↑` increases the value by 10
    - `↓` decreases the value by 10

## Vibe
The project's aesthetics were inspired by arcade game visuals, combined with a vaporwavish color palette.
