# About the project

## What is it?

This is a simple counter. It starts from 0, a number you can increment or decrement by 1 or 10.
To spice things up, the counter is expressed in Celsius grades, that correspond to a specific drink.


## Why this project?


## Features

### Code

 * JavaScript: used to add and manipulate the main content of the project.
 * HTML: used to add metadata and the `return to my personal website` button on the top-left of the page, which is not specifically part of my JavaScript project.
 * Sass: used for customising the `return to my personal website` button, adding animations and making the project responsive with `@media` queries

### How to use

You can change the counter's value by:
 * clicking on the buttons shown on the screen
  - `+1` increases the value by 1
  - `-1` decreases the value by 1
  - `+10` increases the value by 10
  - `-10` decreases the value by 10
 * pressing keyboard keys:
  - `→` increases the value by 1
  - `←` decreases the value by 1
  - `↑` increases the value by 10
  - `↓` decreases the value by 10
